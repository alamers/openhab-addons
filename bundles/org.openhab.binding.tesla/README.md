# Tesla Binding

This binding integrates [Tesla Electrical Vehicles](https://www.tesla.com).
The integration happens through the Tesla Owners Remote API.

## Supported Things

All current Tesla models are supported by this binding.
Access is established through a Tesla account as a bridge.

| Thing Type | Description                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| account    | The account provides access to the vehicles. |
| models     | A Tesla Model S                              |
| model3     | A Tesla Model 3                              |
| modelx     | A Tesla Model X                              |
| modely     | A Tesla Model Y                              |

## Auto Discovery

The account cannot be automatically discovered, but has to be created manually.

Once an account is configured, it is automatically queried for associated vehicles and an Inbox entry is created for each of them.

Note: Vehicles that are asleep might not be discovered, so you might want to wake it up through the Tesla app first.


## Bridge Configuration

The `account` bridge requires an OAuth2 refresh token as the only parameter `refreshToken`.

There are a few 3rd party tools available that have specialized on getting hold of refresh tokens for the Tesla API.
Please note that we in general consider it dangerous to enter your credentials into some 3rd party app - you will have to trust the author not to send or store those credentials anywhere.

- [Tesla Access Token Generator (Chromium Extension](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/chromium-tesla-token-generator)
- [Auth App for Tesla (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auth-app-for-tesla/id1552058613)
- [Tesla Tokens (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.leveugle.teslatokens)

When using one of such apps, simply copy and paste the received refresh token into the account configuration.


## Thing Configuration

The vehicle Thing requires the vehicle's VIN as a configuration parameter `vin`.

Additionally, the optional boolean parameter `allowWakeup` can be set.
This determines whether openHAB is allowed to wake up the vehicle in order to retrieve data from it.
This setting is not recommended as it will result in a significant vampire drain (i.e. energy consumption although the vehicle is parking). 

In addition, the optional boolean parameter `enableEvents` can be set.
By doing so, events streamed by the Tesla back-end system will be captured and processed, providing near real-time updates of some key variables generated by the vehicle.

## Channels

All vehicles support a huge number of channels - the following list shows the standard ones:
