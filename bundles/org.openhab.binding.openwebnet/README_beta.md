# OpenWebNet (BTicino/Legrand) Binding - Installation instructions (Beta version)

The OpenWebNet binding is still under development. This documentation is useful during the beta phase until the binding is added to the official openHAB 2 Addons distribution.
See the [README](./README.md) for the main documentation of the binding and configuration examples.

## Installation

The binding it's still *under development* and not part of the official openHAB distribution.
You must **follow carefully the following instruction steps 1. and 2.** in order to have the binding properly installed and working.

### 1. Bundle Installation

To install this binding two **alternative** options are available: from Marketplace or Manually

### 1a. Install from Marketplace

The binding can be installed from the [Eclipse IoT Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/openwebnet-2x-binding-testing).

Make sure that the [marketplace plugin is activated](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/eclipseiotmarket.html), and then install the *OpenWebNet binding*: from *PaperUI > Add-ons > Bindings > search for 'openwebnet' > INSTALL*.

If you cannot find the binding in the search, probably you have an issue with certificates in your Java environment, that must be updated. Follow [this solution](https://community.openhab.org/t/solved-failed-downloading-marketplace-entries-received-fatal-alert-handshake-failure/52045) to add the required certificates to access all bindings on the Marketplace.

You will have to re-install the binding after an openHAB upgrade. This is a limitation of the Eclipse Marketplace plugin and will be changed in future versions of openHAB.

### 1b. Install Manually

1. Download the [latest released JAR file](https://github.com/mvalla/openhab2-addons/releases)

1. Copy the JAR file to your openHAB2 `addons` folder. On Linux and RaspberryPi it is under `/usr/share/openhab2/addons/`

### 2. Activate Dependencies

After the binding has been installed, from Marketplace or manually, some *features dependencies must be activated manually*:

- from [Karaf console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):
    - `feature:install openhab-transport-serial`
    - for openHAB 2.4.x:
	    - `feature:install esh-io-transport-upnp`
    - for openHAB 2.5.x and later:
	    - `feature:install openhab-core-io-transport-upnp`

The binding should now be installed: check in *PaperUI > Configuration > Bindings*.

After upgrading the binding to a new version, there is no need to activate dependencies again.

**However dependencies must be activated again if you upgrade openHAB to a new version or clean its cache.**

## Upgrade of the binding

When upgrading the binding to a new version you may need to remove OpenWebNet Things before un-installing the old binding, and discover/configure them again after binding has been updated. Re-discoverd things will not change their ID, so no other configuration change is needed and re-discovered things will be automatically linked to previous items.

Instead of removing things also re-setting the bridge in things properties should help.

If things are defined using .things file, they do not need to be removed/re-created.

### Upgrade - Marketplace installation

1. Go to *PaperUI > Add-ons > Bindings > search `openweb` > UNINSTALL*
1. reload the page in the browser to make sure latest version is selected
1. search again `openweb` > INSTALL

### Upgrade - Manual installation

Since openHAB uses some cache mechanisms to load bindings, it is not enough to remove and update the binding JAR file from `addons` folder:

1. From [Karaf console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):
    - `bundle:list` to list all bundles and take note of current bundle `<ID>` for the OpenWebNet Binding
    - `bundle:uninstall <ID>` to remove previous version of the binding
1. remove the previous version of the binding JAR file from `addons/` folder
1. copy the new version of the binding JAR file to `addons/` folder

The new version of the binding should now be installed, check *PaperUI > Configuration > Bindings*.

## Debugging and Log Files

This binding is currently *under development*. 

To help testing it and provide feedbacks, this is the procedure to set log level to `DEBUG`:

   - from [Karaf console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):
     - `log:set DEBUG org.openhab.binding.openwebnet`
     - `log:set DEBUG org.openwebnet` 

Both `log:set` commands *are important* to log OWN commands exchanged between the binding and the OpenWebNet gateway.

Log files are written to either `userdata/log` (manual setup) or `/var/log/openhab2` (Linux and RaspberryPi image setup) and can be accessed using standard text reading software. 

The interesting file to provide for feedback is `openhab.log` (`events.log` is not so important).

## FAQs & Known Issues

### FAQs

#### My BTicino devices are visible from PaperUI but cannot be discovered by Google Home / Alexa

Not all device types are supported by Google Home / Alexa and the respective openHAB add-ons. This is not a limitation of the binding.
Visit the links at the end of section [Integration with Assistants](./README.md#integration-with-assistants) to check compatibility with your selected assistant.

#### When message/feature XYZ will be supported ?

You can check if someone has already requested support for a message/feature here: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mvalla/openhab2-addons/issues).
If not, add a new issue. Issues are organised by milestones, but deadlines -of course- are not guaranteed (other volunteer developers are welcome!).

### Known Issues

For a full list of current open issues / features requests see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mvalla/openhab2-addons/issues)

- In some cases dimmers connected to a F429 Dali-interface cannot be discovered, even if switched ON and dimmed. This looks like as a limitation of some gateways that do not report status of Dali devices when requested. See: https://github.com/mvalla/openhab2-addons/issues/14
