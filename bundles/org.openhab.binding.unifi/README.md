# UniFi Binding

This binding integrates with [Ubiquiti UniFi Networks](https://www.ubnt.com/products/#unifi) allowing for presence detection of network clients.


## Supported Things

* `controller` - An instance of the UniFi controller software
* `site` - A site thing with connection statistics
* `wlan` - A wireless network thing. Control Wi-Fi network and easy access to access.
* `wirelessClient` - Any wireless client connected to a UniFi wireless network
* `wiredClient` - A wired client connected to the UniFi network
* `poePort` - A PoE (Power over Ethernet) port on a UniFi switch

## Discovery

The binding supports discovery of things connected to a UniFi controller (Bridge).
To discover things start the discovery process manually.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at the Bridge and Thing levels.

## Bridge Configuration

You need at least one UniFi Controller (Bridge) for this binding to work.
It requires a network accessible instance of the [Ubiquiti Networks Controller Software](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi).

The following table describes the Bridge configuration parameters:

| Parameter                | Description                                                                 | Config   | Default |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--------- | ------- |
| host                     | Hostname of IP address of the UniFi Controller                              | Required | -       |
| port                     | Port of the UniFi Controller. For UniFi OS, the default port is usually 443 | Required | -       |
| unifios                  | If the UniFi Controller is running on UniFi OS                              | Required | false   |
| username                 | The username to access the UniFi Controller                                 | Required | -       |
| password                 | The password to access the UniFi Controller                                 | Required | -       |
| refresh                  | Refresh interval in seconds                                                 | Optional | 10      |

## Thing Configuration

You must define a UniFi Controller (Bridge) before defining UniFi Things for this binding to work.

### `site`

The following table describes the `site` configuration parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  | Config   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------|--------- | ------- |
| sid          | The name, description or id of the site                      | Required | -       |

### `wlan`

The following table describes the `wlan` configuration parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  | Config   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------|--------- | ------- |
| wid          | The name or id of the WLAN                                   | Required | -       |

### `wirelessClient` & `wiredClient`

The following table describes the `wirelessClient` & `wiredClient` configuration parameters:


| Parameter    | Description                                                  | Config   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------|--------- | ------- |
| cid          | The MAC address, IP address, hostname or alias of the client | Required | -       |
| site         | The site where the client should be found                    | Optional | -       |
| considerHome | The interval in seconds to consider the client as home       | Optional | 180     |

Here's some additional notes regarding the thing configuration parameters:

##### `cid`

The `cid` parameter is a universal "client identifier". It accepts the following values:

  1. MAC address [highest priority]
  1. IP address
  1. Hostname (as show by the controller)
  1. Alias (as defined by you in the controller UI) [lowest priority]

The priority essentially means the binding attempts to lookup by MAC address, then by IP address, then by hostname and finally by alias.
Once it finds a matching client, it short circuits and stops searching.
Most of the time, you will simply use the  MAC address.

##### `site`

The `site` parameter is optional. If you leave it blank, the client will appear `ONLINE` if found in *any* site defined on the controller.

You may use the `site` parameter as a filter if you only want the client to appear home if it is found in the site defined in the `site` parameter.

Additionally, you may use friendly site names as they appear in the controller UI.

##### `considerHome`

The `considerHome` parameter allows you to control how quickly the binding marks a client as away.
For example, using the default of `180` (seconds), the binding will report a client away as soon as `lastSeen` + `180` (seconds) < `now`.

### `poePort`

The following table describes the `poePort` configuration parameters:


| Parameter  | Description                                               | Config   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| portNumber | The port number as reported by the switch (starts with 1) | Required |
| macAddress | The MAC address of the switch device the port is part of  | Required |
