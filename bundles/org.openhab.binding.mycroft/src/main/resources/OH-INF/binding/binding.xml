	<description>
		Connects to a Mycroft instance in order to receive information from, and send commands to it. Typical
		usage includes
		triggering Mycroft to listen (as if a wake word was detected), sending text for Mycroft to speak,
		reacting on some
		specific intent, command skills by faking a spoken utterance, etc.
